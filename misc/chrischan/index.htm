These sites are a continuation and modification of ChrisChan's Websites. They 
are hosted on 2003page because it's, well, a easily accessible site to dump 
stuff to. The First CWC's PokeSite has been taken from Internet Archive, because 
the CWCki's webmaster, Cogsdev, has not decided to make a actual archive of the 
first PokeSite, Everything else is taken from the CWCki's Archives. The 
Cwcipedia will NOT be added due to it being PHP-heavy (Like every other 
MediaWiki Wiki) and it's DMCAs from 20th Century Fox and The Coca-Cola Company. 
The Luv Shack, due to it's NSFW nature. WILL NOT be archived, and will not be 
shown on the site.<br>
