.:_PF94's CWCarchive_:.

These sites are a continuation and modification of ChrisChan's Websites. They are hosted on 2003page because it's, well, a easily accessible site to dump stuff to. The First CWC's PokeSite has been taken from Internet Archive, because the CWCki's webmaster, Cogsdev, has not decided to make a actual archive of the first PokeSite, Everything else is taken from the CWCki's Archives. The Cwcipedia will NOT be added due to it being PHP-heavy (Like every other MediaWiki Wiki) and it's DMCAs from 20th Century Fox and The Coca-Cola Company. The Luv Shack, due to it's NSFW nature. WILL NOT be archived, and will not be shown on the site.

---POKESITE 1 CHANGES---

> Chris' old email has been replaced with PF94's
> Fixed any typos
> Changed banner so that it doesn't say that it's in construction and says that it's the 1st Pokesite
