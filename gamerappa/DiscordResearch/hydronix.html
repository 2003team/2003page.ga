<p>I was suspicious when I saw this pop up, A advertisement for a semi-popular 
discord with 8k people, It was posted in 3 AM eastern time.</p>
<p>It's 3 PM eastern time, I decided to join it because I was suspicious. When I 
joined, Mee6 advertised me at the same time welcoming me, to a invite for 
Partnership Paradise, Which is the same server.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Welcome.jpg" width="468" height="142"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, General isn't that active. It's only full of these images 
(like the one above welcoming me on the server) Everything is active on the 
advertisements. Most people on this discord are teenagers between the age of 12 
to 16, according to the Introduce Yourself channel.</p>
