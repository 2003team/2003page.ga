<h1>ChazizYT</h1>
<p><u><b>Background:</b></u> ChazizYT is a semi-active obscure YouTube channel 
run by a kid from south-western Quebec. It was first launched in September 27th 
2015, it was originally a French-Canadian tutorial channel. However has changed 
into a English-Canadian tech/gaming/animation channel. The channel took a 
year-long hiatus in 2017 but has returned to make content from time to time.</p>

<p>1st Logo (March 12, 2016)</p>
<p><u>Nicknames</u>: &quot;Jumping Robloxian&quot; &quot;The beginning of the Rocky Robloxian&quot; 
&quot;Rushed Intro&quot;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="index.1.jpg" width="294" height="137"><img border="0" src="index.2.jpg" width="295" height="137"></p>
<p><u>Logo</u>: We see a old robloxian with a noob color-scheme on the famous 
Bliss image from Windows XP, The robloxians jumps, which makes the screen bright 
and it shows a Windows 10 Hero Wallpaper (no longer current, i think) and 
another Robloxian falls, It's Chaziz's infamous Rocky avatar, albeit in a 
different t-shirt and with Robloxian 2.0. We see &quot;<font color="#333300"><span style="background-color: #009900">Chazpelo</span></font>&quot; 
on the bottom and it rotates.</p>
<p><font size="3"><u>Availability</u><font color="#333333">: Extinct, Was 
shortly replaced with the next logo</font></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><u>Editor's Note</u>: The Rocky robloxian character was 
planned to be a villian on <i>The Adventures of Several Robloxians </i>according 
to a cancelled draft. It is uncertain if this idea will be used again. Also, 
It's the only Chaziz video to have a recommended list full of videos for little 
kids, possibly due to the tags being slightly related to Paw Patrol (verify 
that)</font></p>
